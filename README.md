### âœŠ

I like to hack things together.

Currently building The Last CodeBender Nation.

### codeÂ·bendÂ·er: [Definition]

    Unique individual who has unlocked the ability to read the code of the Matrix, and shape it at will.
    He is not just some programmer with no purpose.
    He has a holistic view of every situation.
    This makes him a feared opponent for all the agents of the Matrix.
    Because the CodeBender is not a slave to the system,
    He only uses his ability for the sake of mankind.
